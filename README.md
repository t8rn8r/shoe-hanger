# Shoe Hanger
3D printed hanger system for shoe storage. Simple and modular.

## Goal
- Store shoes with the most space-efficient method possible.
- Keep shoes off the floor and in good condition. 
- Can hang on the same bar as clothes hangers.
- Portable: collapsable and light for easy traveling.

## Background
I have a lot of shoes that currently live on the floor in my closet. They take up a lot of space and often get stepped on and dirty. This project gets the shoes off the floor and hanging up with the clothes. 

Since I travel a lot, this system needs to collapse into as small of a space as possible without having small parts that can easily be lost.
